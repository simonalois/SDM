Keywords:  
species distribution modelling, environmental predictor variables, partitioning effects, soil information, Alpine environment, distribution ranges 

Highlights:
- species distribution of silver fir and European beech is modelled with deep neural networks
- methods for addressing strong imbalance of absent and present are evaluated 
- regional and continental occurrence data and predictor variables are integrated
- predictive power of climatological, soil and topographical information were disintegrated
